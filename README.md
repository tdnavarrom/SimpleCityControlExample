# SimpleCityControlExample
A simple example for an smart city control with Android Studio, made with Raspberry pi and Google Firebase.

The city only uses a sound sensor that turns on a led. (Simulates a car crash.)
And has a park that only turns on and off leds.

The Android App controls all of the above lights.

This is just a simple example for IOT with Android Studio, Firebase and Raspberry Pi.
