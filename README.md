# SimpleCityControlExample
A simple example for an smart city control with Android Studio, made with Raspberry pi and Google Firebase.

The city only uses a sound sensor that turns on a led. (Simulates a car crash.)
And has a park that only turns on and off leds.

The Android App controls all of the above lights.

The zip folder is the original Android Studio Project, for you to use it, replace the CityControl/app/google-services.json file with the one Firebase gives you when creating a project.

This is just a simple example for IOT with Android Studio, Firebase and Raspberry Pi.
